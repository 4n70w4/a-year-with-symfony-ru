### Separate company and product code

Your situation as a Symfony developer is most likely:

- You are working for a company.
- You have customers (internal or external) for whom you create web applications.

When you start working on a new application, you will put your project’s code in the /src directory.
But before you start, add two new directories inside this /src directory: /src/NameOfYourCompany
and /src/NameOfTheProduct. Of course, these directory names should also be reflected in the
namespaces of the classes you create for your project.

Whenever you start working on a new feature for the application - think of which part you
could in theory reuse, and which part is unique for the application you are working on. Even when
this reusable code will in practice never be reused, its quality will benefit from this mindset. Start
developing classes in the company namespace. Only when you really feel the need to use something
that is specific for the project, move it over to the product namespace, or use some kind of extension
principle (a subclass, configuration, event listeners, etc.).

Writing reusable code for your company does not mean that it should be open sourced. It just
means that you should write it as if it will be open sourced. You don’t have to create side-projects
for all the company code right away. You can develop it inside the project you’re currently working
on and maybe later make it ready for reuse in another project. Read more about the practical side
of this in [Dependency management and version control](#todo)

### Separate library and bundle code

When you notice that you are writing classes and interfaces that have no relation with the entire
Symfony framework, or only with some parts of the framework, you should separate your code
into “library” code and “bundle” code. The library code is the part of the code that is more or less
stand-alone (although it could have some external dependencies). Library code could be reused by
a developer who works with the Zend framework, or with the Silex micro-framework (to name just
a few). Bundle code replaces or extends some classes from the library code, adding extra Symfonyspecific features. 
It defines a bundle configuration, and it has service definitions, to make instances
of library classes available in the application. A bundle in this way just makes the library code
available, while requiring just a minimum effort from developers who want to use the library in
their Symfony project.

These are the things that belong inside a bundle:

- Controllers
- Container extensions
- Service definitions
- Compiler passes
- Event subscribers
- Container-aware classes that extend more generic classes
- Form types
- Routing configuration
- Other metadata
- ...

The list could be much longer. But it could also be much shorter. When you think about it, only
the first couple of things on the list are really specific for bundles (i.e. used only in the context of a
standard Symfony project). All of the other things could also be used in projects that only make use
of specific Symfony Components. For instance form types could also be used in any PHP project
with only the Form Component installed.

### Reduce coupling to the framework

You can go quite far into reducing coupling to the Symfony framework or to one of its components,
and thereby making your code even more reusable.

#### Event listeners over event subscribers

For example you should prefer event listeners over event subscribers. Event subscribers are special
event listeners, that implement EventSubscriberInterface:

{lang="php"}
~~~~~~~~~~~~
use Symfony\Component\EventDispatcher\EventSubscriberInterface;

class SendConfirmationMailListener implements EventSubscriberInterface
{
    public static function getSubscribedEvents()
    {
        return array(
            AccountEvents::NEW_ACCOUNT_CREATED => 'onNewAccount'
        );
    }

    public function onNewAccount(AccountEvent $event)
    {
        ...
    }
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can register event subscribers like this in a very clean way using the service tag kernel.event_-
subscriber:

{lang="xml"}
~~~~~~~~~~~~
<service id="send_confirmation_mail_listener"
    class="SendConfirmationMailListener">
    <tag name="kernel.event_subscriber" />
</service>
~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are some problems with this approach:

1. An event subscriber becomes totally useless when the Symfony EventDispatcher Component
is not available, even though there is nothing Symfony-specific about this event listener.
2. onNewAccount() receives an AccountEvent object, but it is nowhere determined that such an
object can only arise from an event with the name AccountEvents::NEW_ACCOUNT_CREATED.

Therefore an event listener which is actually an event subscriber is not good for reusable code.
It couples the code to the EventDispatcher Component. It is better to remove the interface, remove
the method required by the interface and register the listener methods manually using the service
tag kernel.event_listener:

{lang="xml"}
~~~~~~~~~~~~
<service id="send_confirmation_mail_listener"
    class="SendConfirmationMailListener">
    <tag name="kernel.event_listener"
        event="new_account_created" method="onNewAccount" />
</service>
~~~~~~~~~~~~

#### Constructor arguments over fetching container parameters

When you know that the service container has just the parameter you need, it can be tempting to
inject the entire container to just retrieve this specific parameter:

{lang="php"}
~~~~~~~~~~~~
use Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\ContainerInterface;

class SendConfirmationMailListener
{
    private $container;

    public function __construct(ContainerInterface $container)
    {
        $this->container = $container;
    }

    private function sendConfirmationMail()
    {
        $mailFrom = $this->container->getParameter('send_mail_from');

        ...
    }
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The corresponding service definition would be:

{lang="xml"}
~~~~~~~~~~~~
<service id="send_confirmation_mail_listener"
    class="SendConfirmationMailListener">
    <argument type="service" id="service_container" />
</service>
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is obviously very bad for the mobility of this service: it can now only function when there
is a Symfony service container available in the application. To make matters worse: even if there
is such a service container, it is by no means certain that a parameter send_mail_from would be
defined.

Therefore, always inject container parameters as constructor arguments, like this:

{lang="xml"}
~~~~~~~~~~~~
<service id="send_confirmation_mail_listener"
    class="SendConfirmationMailListener">
    <argument">%send_mail_from%</argument>
</service>
~~~~~~~~~~~~

#### Constructor arguments over fetching container services

Just like fetching parameters from the service container directly, using the service container as a
service locator is an equally bad idea.

{lang="php"}
~~~~~~~~~~~~
class SendConfirmationMailListener
{
    private $container;

    public function __construct(ContainerInterface $container)
    {
        $this->container = $container;
    }

    private function sendConfirmationMail()
    {
        $mailer = $this->container->get('mailer');

        ...
    }
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The reason for doing things like this is usually performance. Say we would inject the mailer
directly as a constructor argument:

{lang="php"}
~~~~~~~~~~~~
class SendConfirmationMailListener
{
    private $mailer;

    public function __construct(\Swift_Mailer $mailer)
    {
        $this->mailer = $mailer;
    }
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now, this class is an event listener and it listens to the new_account_created event. Whenever
the listener gets instantiated, the mailer service will also be initialized, even when only in some
cases a mail would be sent. This may take some time (and at least some system resources).
Though this is indeed true, injecting the service container to fetch a service is bad because:

1. It couples your code to a very specific type of service container (the Symfony service
container).
2. The silent and possibly wrong assumption is that a mailer service exists (and that it is a
\Swift_Mailer object).
3. Your service could fetch many more things from the service container than it should be
allowed to.

The thing is: people get inspired to inject the service container from using the standard Symfony
Controller class, which implements the ContainerAwareInterface. You basically should not use
this interface nor its basic implementation ContainerAware. There are good use cases, but in most
situations you really don’t need the entire service container: you need a specific service. And your
class should be coupled to this service’s class or preferably its interface, not to the service container.

#### The performance issue

But what about the performance issue then? Well, since Symfony 2.3 you don’t need to worry about
that anymore. You can add the lazy="true" attribute to service definitions for which you want a
[proxy class to be created](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/dependency_injection/lazy_services.html). 
The result is that you can inject the real dependencies into your services,
but they are only fully initialized when you call any of their methods for the first time. I created a
small extension for this, the [LazyServicesBundle](https://github.com/matthiasnoback/LazyServicesBundle) 
that allows you to make services lazy by pointing out (constructor) arguments that should be turned into 
lazy-loading services.

#### Framework-agnostic controllers

In Symfony applications controllers are usually the things that are most tightly coupled to the
framework. When you always like to minimize coupling to anything (like I do), controllers seem
therefore a good candidate to do so. We should however first consider the things that most controllers
do when they are being executed:

- Take something from the request (either a route parameter, or a query attribute).
- Fetch some service from the service container and do the thing that was requested.
- Render a template with the variable retrieved from the service…
- Or add a flash message to the session, to notify the user of the result of the action…
- And generate the URL of some other page and redirect the user to it.

All of these things should be done in the way the framework expects you to do them. As you
can imagine, this will make your controller very much coupled to the framework. And it should be!

A Symfony controller would not function very well in another application which does not use the
Symfony Router, the Symfony HttpKernel and the Symfony HttpFoundation components. And such
an application I would like to call a “Symfony application”.

So when it comes to controller classes you may skip any steps you would normally take to make
a class decoupled. Therefore, don’t be reluctant to extend your controller classes from the standard
Symfony Controller class. It will be very helpful since it provides many shortcut methods for things
you often do inside a controller (e.g. createForm(), generateUrl(), createNotFoundException(),
etc.).

Also, you don’t have to define services for your controllers. They don’t need to be reused as
a service. However, I sometimes feel like it is a good idea to be able to take full control over the
construction process of a controller, which would otherwise be instantiated “magically” using the
new operator by the ControllerResolver, after which - also even more magically - the container
will be injected, whenever the controller implements ContainerAwareInterface (read more about
this in [All the things a controller can be](#todo).

One last remark before you start happily coupling your controllers to the framework again: you
should still try to make controllers as small as possible. When you enter the controller, you should
quickly move the focus away from the controller to some kind of service that does the real work.
See also [Slim controllers](#todo) for motivation and practical suggestions.

#### Thin commands

Writing a console command is very easy and generally recommended to provide ways to execute
specific tasks for your bundle using the command line. But commands should be treated the same
way [as a controller gets treated](#todo): it should be a thin layer between the input the user provides, the
services that are used to execute the task and the output that the user should receive about successes
and failures.

Therefore, ideally, the execute() method of a command contains some checks on the input
provided, and then immediately it fetches a service from the service container and calls some action
on it.

{lang="php"}
~~~~~~~~~~~~
namespace Matthias\BatchProcessBundle\Command;

use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Command\ContainerAwareCommand;
use Symfony\Component\Console\Input\InputInterface;
use Symfony\Component\Console\Output\OutputInterface;

class BatchProcessCommand extends ContainerAwareCommand
{
    protected function configure()
    {
        $this->setName('matthias:batch-process');
    }

    protected function execute(
        InputInterface $input,
        OutputInterface $output
    ) {
        $processor = $this->getContainer()->get('batch_processor');

        foreach (array('main', 'sub', 'special') as $collection) {
            $processor->process($collection);
        }
    }
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you feel the need to do more things inside a command, move as many responsibilities as
you can to specific services.

This again makes it easier to reuse command code, even with an entirely different library for
executing commands. It also helps you to test the code that really “does things” better, since testing
code inside a command is much more difficult and much less isolated than testing code in normal
PHP classes.

Moving code away from the command class will make it more difficult to generate relevant
output for the console. There is a perfect solution for this: use a bit of 
[aspect oriented programming](http://php-and-symfony.matthiasnoback.nl/2013/07/symfony2-rich-console-command-output-using-aop/)
to generate output based on the actual method calls and their return values.

#### The environment

Symfony has a very nice way of separating and cascading bundle configuration for different
environments. These environments are called (by convention) dev, test and prod. This value is
however entirely arbitrary. It is not even a class constant somewhere, but it’s just the first argument
used when instantiating the kernel in the front controllers in /web:

{lang="php"}
~~~~~~~~~~~~
// in /web/app_dev.php
$kernel = new AppKernel('dev', true);
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You should therefore never rely on the environment name or hard-code it inside any part of your
code. Things like this must be avoided:

{lang="php"}
~~~~~~~~~~~~
class SendConfirmationMailListener
{
    private $environment;

    public function __construct($environment)
    {
        $this->environment = $environment;
    }

    private function sendConfirmationMail()
    {
        if ($this->environment === 'dev') {
            // always send the mail to matthiasnoback@gmail.com :)
        }
    }
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any modification of behavior depending on the environment of the application should take
place on the level of your bundle’s configuration and even then it should be implicit, since which
environment names a developer uses is up to him, not up to you. In fact, when you copy everything
from config_dev.yml to config_prod.yml your production environment will look and feel just like
a development environment.

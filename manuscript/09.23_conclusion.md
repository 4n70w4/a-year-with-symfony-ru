## Conclusion

Looking back at the examples above I think we may conclude that the use of annotations inside
controllers is a great way to influence the application flow.

Controller annotations allow you to write domain-specific code in a higher-level language (the
“annotation language”). The example of the @RequiresCredits annotation made this especially clear.
It hides a lot of application logic from the user. Such annotations actually form domain-specific
languages on their own. They make it easier for others to understand what is going on and allows
them to implement the same thing faster, without copying and pasting complicated PHP code. This
helps you prevent code duplication and promote reusability.

So next time you need a way to reuse part of a controller, ask yourself: is this a nice and justifiable use case for 
introducing a controller annotation? It will not take too much time to create a prototype for it if you use the 
[matthiasnoback/symfony-controller-annotation package](https://packagist.org/packages/matthiasnoback/symfony-controller-annotation).

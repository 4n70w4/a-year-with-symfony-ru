15 Input validation
Any input your application receives from the outside world should be checked and processed before actually being used or stored in any way.
15.1 Safe forms
Symfony has several important tools that you can use in the fight for clean input: the Form Component and the Validator Component. Most Symfony developers already trust the Form Component with their lives:
// persist!
This is mostly a good thing since the Form and Validator Component both are quite good, and they can be trusted to do what they say. But: you should not trust them blindly (what can you trust blindly?).
HTML5 validation
Back in the days when we used to write PHP applications by hand from start to end, we were taught to validate form input. For instance we did not want users to leave the “name” field blank. But now we can build a form in a form (which represents the field) and we set it’s required option to true. When you open the form in the browser and try to submit it with no values inserted, it will show you a nice error message (which is in fact a feature of HTML5) instead of immediately submitting the form.However,ifyoudisablethisclient-sidevalidation,byaddinganovalidateHTML5attributeto the form tag, you will notice that by default there is no server-side validation at all. So, the first thing you need to do when working with forms (and maybe for the dev environment only) is disabling the HTML5 validation:
1 <form{%ifapp.debug%}novalidate="true"{%endif%}> Now you can test the server-side validation of your form.
if($request->isMethod('POST')){ $form->bind($request);
if ($form->isValid()) {

Validation constraints
Usually you have some domain object, let’s say an entity, that you want to create or modify using a form. You would then set the form’s data_class option to the class name of this entity. In the buildForm method you can instruct the FormBuilder to add certain fields corresponding to attributes of the entity. Now to validate the form data, you need to be very secure in adding constraints to the attributes (in my opinion preferably using annotations). This is nothing but the usual, and it’s very well documented1:
1 namespaceMatthias\AccountBundle\Entity;
2
3 useSymfony\Component\Validator\ConstraintsasAssert; 4
5 classUser
6{
7
8
9
10 11 12
/**
 * @Assert\Email()
 * @Assert\NotBlank()
 */
private $emailAddress; }
Custom validation constraints
There are times where the standard validation constraints bundled with the Symfony Validator Component are not (specific) enough for validating your data. Don’t give up and add custom validation constraints2, and custom validators for validating this data.
Forms without an entity
When you have data which does not have a one-to-one correspondence to an entity, the Forms documentation tells you that you can just provide no data class and in fact build the form inline inside your controller:

$defaultData = array('message' => 'Type your message here'); $form = $this->createFormBuilder($defaultData)
        ->add('name', 'text')
        ->add('email', 'email')
        ->add('message', 'textarea')
        ->getForm();
    $form->handleRequest($request);
if ($form->isValid()) {
// data is an array with "name", "email", and "message" keys $data = $form->getData();
} }
This to me sounds like a bad idea, for two reasons: first of all, you should always define a form using a custom form type (extending from AbstractType), like this:
useSymfony\Component\Form\AbstractType; useSymfony\Component\Form\FormBuilderInterface;
classContactFormTypeextendsAbstractType
public function buildForm( FormBuilderInterface $builder, array $options
$builder
            ->add('name', 'text')
            ->add('email', 'email')
            ->add('message', 'textarea')
; }
public function getName() {
return 'contact_form'; }
}

This will put all the logic related to the form in one place, making it reusable and much better maintainable.

$resolver->setDefaults(array(
'data_class' => 'LifeOnline\ContactBundle\Model\ContactDetails'
)); }
}
Input validation 121
But you should also always provide a data_class option. The data from the contact form will not be persisted, but still it has a certain coherent structure and also a very clear meaning. So choose a suitable name for the data object of your form, like ContactDetails, create a class with the right fields and add some assertions to each field to ensure the object contains consistent data:
1 useSymfony\Component\Validator\ConstraintsasAssert; 2
3 classContactDetails
4{
} useSymfony\Component\OptionsResolver\OptionsResolverInterface;
Now set this class as the data_class option of the ContactFormType:
1
2
3
4{
5 public function setDefaultOptions(OptionsResolverInterface $resolver) 6{
classContactFormTypeextendsAbstractType
Your data will be in much better shape since it is now encapsulated, validated and totally under control. You can:
• Prevent bad data from entering the attributes by filtering the data in setters:
Input validation 122
1 class ContactDetails
2{
3 public function setMessage($message) 4{
5 $this->message = strip_tags($message); 6}
7}
• Provide default values a lot easier (without having to know the structure of the expected array):
1 public function contactAction(Request $request)
2{
3 $contactDetails = ContactDetails::createForUser($this->getUser()); 4
5 $form = $this->createForm(new ContactFormType(), $contactDetails); 6
7 // ...
8}
• Work with an object of a known type, after binding and validating the form:
1 public function contactAction(Request $request) 2{
3 4 5 6 7 8 9
10 11 12 13
$form = $this->createForm(new ContactFormType());
if ($request->isMethod('POST')) { $form->bind($request);
if ($form->isValid()) {
} }
}
$contactDetails = $form->getData();
// $contactDetails is an instance of ContactDetails
 All forms in your application should...
• Haveadata_classoptionpointingtoaspecificclass.
• BedefinedintheirownclassextendingfromAbstractType.
• Preferably have their own service definition, for better reusability.

15.2 Validate values from Request
The Request object is in part just a wrapper for PHP’s superglobals. In /web/app.php you can see
how the Request object gets created:
1 $request=Request::createFromGlobals();
Inside this method you find this simple line of code:
1 $request=newstatic($_GET,$_POST,array(),$_COOKIE,$_FILES,$_SERVER);
So even though it may feel much more secure to fetch request data using $request->query->get('page'), it is in fact no more secure than just $_GET['page']. Though within the Symfony context it is always
better to use the methods on the Request class, you should still be wary about these values, validate
them and force them into the right format. Strict typing, and checking for allowed values and ranges
is quite necessary.
Request attributes Route parameters
First of all, when a URI pattern contains wildcard values, like id in /comment/{id}, and a certain request matches this pattern, the RouterListener will make sure that all the parameters are copied over to the request object as attributes. These request attributes will be used by the ControllerResolver to collect arguments for the controller based on its parameter names and type hints. See Events leading to a response for a more detailed explanation of this process.
Since most controller arguments are being copied more or less directly from the URI of the request, you need to be extra careful when it comes to handling them. First of all you have to think about requirements for route parameters (like id). Requirements are to be defined as regular expressions. The default requirement for route parameters is [ˆ/]+: they may contain any character except a slash. So you must always define your own requirements, like \w+, which means at least one “word” character (i.e. a-z, A-Z or 0-9, or underscore) or \d+, which means at least one “number” character (i.e. 0-9). If you don’t know regular expressions yet, you should really learn them (as you may have noticed they are also used when working with paths defined in security.yml). Below you will find some examples of route parameters with requirements:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
10
11
12
13
14
15
16
/**
  * id can only be a number:
  * @Route("/comment/{id}", requirements={"id"="\d+"})
  */
/**
 * alias can be at least one lowercase letter, a number or a dash:
 * @Route("/user/{alias}", requirements={"alias"="[a-z0-9\-]+"})
 */
/**
* type can only be commercial or non-commercial: * @Route("/create-account/{type}", requirements={ * "type"="commercial|non-commercial"
*})
*/
It is important to verify the correctness of these values in this early stage, otherwise in- correct values might result as arguments of method calls to services, where they may cause InvalidArgumentExceptions, or worse: unexplainable errors.
Query or request parameters
There are also situations where you want to be more flexible concerning the input for your controller: you may want to support query parameters in your URI, like ?page=1, or request parameters sent using the content of the request (e.g. POST data). But these values are by no means trustworthy. Query and POST data can both easily be modified to not be what you expect it to be. Therefore, when you retrieve this data from the Request object:
• LetvalidationbehandledbytheFormandValidatorComponentbyusingForm::bind()and Form::isValid()
• Or:
– Cast the values to the type that you expect (in most situations either a string or an
integer) and
– ValidatethesevaluesyourselfbycallingthevalidateValue()methodofthevalidator
service. You could think of validating the range of a value (“should be at least 1”), or one of multiple options (“should be any of ‘commercial’, ‘non-commercial’”).
For instance:
Input validation 124
5 6 7 8 9
10
11
12
13
14
15
16
17
$userTypeConstraint = new Choice(array(
'choices' => array('commercial', 'non-commercial')
);
$errorList = $this->get('validator')->validateValue(
    $request->query->get('userType'),
    $userTypeConstraint
);
if (count($errorList) == 0) {
// the provided user type is valid
Input validation 125
1 useSymfony\Component\Validator\Constraints\Choice; 2
3 publicfunctioncreateAccountAction()
4{
} }
 Don’t use $request->get()
Don’t use $request->get(), because this is what happens inside:
1 publicfunctionget($key,$default=null,$deep=false) 2{
3
4
5
6
7 8}
return $this->query->get($key, $this->attributes->get($key,
        $this->request->get($key, $default, $deep),
    $deep),
$deep);
Always retrieve values specifically from the query, the request data or the request attributes. When you are used to using PHP superglobals, this is the translation to the respective parameter bags of the Request class:
$_GET['key'] ⇒ “$request->query->get(‘key’) $_POST['key'] ⇒ “$request->request->get(‘key’)
Use the ParamFetcher
There is one tool that I would like to mention here. It is part of the FOSRestBundle3 which provides many tools for easily creating a REST-like webservice. It provides a very nice way of pre-validating
3https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSRestBundle
 
Input validation 126
query parameters by first adding some configuration in the form of an annotation for each query parameter that you need. For example, this is how you can configure a page query parameter which should consist only of digits, being “1” by default:
1 useFOS\RestBundle\Request\ParamFetcher;
2 useFOS\RestBundle\Controller\Annotations\QueryParam;
3
4 /**
5 *
6 *
7 *
8 *
9 *
@QueryParam(
  name="page",
  requirements="\d+",
  default="1",
  description="Page number"
10 *)
11 */
12 publicfunctionlistAction(ParamFetcher$paramFetcher)
13 {
14 $page = $paramFetcher->get('page');
15 }
It works almost exactly the same for POST data without a corresponding form:
1 useFOS\RestBundle\Request\ParamFetcher;
2 useFOS\RestBundle\Controller\Annotations\RequestParam;
3
4 /**
5 * @RequestParam(name="username", requirements="\w+")
6 */
7 publicfunctiondeleteAccountAction(ParamFetcher$paramFetcher)
8{ 9
}
10
1 2 3
Even though your application will not have a REST API, you can still just install the FOSRest- Bundle bundle without many side-effects. Just make sure you disable all built-in listeners except the ParamFetcherListener:
#in/app/config/config.yml
fos_rest:
    param_fetcher_listener: true
...
Input validation 127
15.3 Sanitizing HTML
You likely have forms in your application allowing users to enter some kind of rich text, with bold, italic or underlined text, and maybe you allow users to add their own link tags. Well, this is of course a very dangerous thing when it comes to security. You should take very good care of restricting users in their use of HTML tags but also in them adding HTML attributes, which can actually be more dangerous, especially when they contain JavaScript. And don’t think that alert('Hi!'); is the worst thing a user can do. Even mismatching tags can spoil things - think about what a simple </div> in some random spot could do in most sites.
First of all: don’t rely on things like Markdown to solve your HTML injection problem. The specification of Markdown clearly says that any HTML in the source text should be left intact and added “as is” to the generated output. Second: don’t rely on the second argument of strip_tags to allow some tags since this also allows any attribute for these tags. Third: don’t dream up your own regular expressions for allowing some tags and attributes. There will always be hacks that circumvent your handwritten rules. Instead, use HTMLPurifier4 and configure it properly for specific situations allowing rich (HTML) text.
There is an excellent bundle which integrates HTMLPurifier with any Symfony application: the ExerciseHTMLPurifierBundle5. It defines HTMLPurifier services for each configuration set you define in config.yml. It also supports automatic filtering of form values.
Automatic sanitizing
The thing is: with every Symfony application you have to manually take care of sanitizing input. It would be great if all request attributes would be automatically filtered according to some rules, or when every form or entity would contain only known-to-be-clean values. Unfortunately there is no such thing in the open source world that I am aware of right now. A prototype of the desired functionality can be found in the DMSFilterBundle6, but in its current state this bundle does not handle every situation well. It filters only form input for the root objects of forms. It also does not filter values manually set upon entities, documents, etc.

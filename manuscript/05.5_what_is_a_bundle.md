## 5 Что такое "бандл (bundle)"

Как мы уже могли отметить в предыдущей главе, запуск Symfony-приложения означает загрузку ядра и
обработку запроса или выполнение команд. В свою очередь, загрузка ядра означает: 
загрузку всех бандлов и регистрацию их расширений сервисного контейнера (которые в любом банде расположены в 
директории `DependencyInjection`). 

The container extension usually loads a services.xml file (but this can be
anything) and the bundle’s configuration, defined in a separate class, usually in the same namespace,
called Configuration. These things together (bundle, container extension and configuration) can be
used to wire up your bundle: you can define parameters and services so that the functionality you
provide inside your bundle is available to other parts of the application. You can even go one step
further and register compiler passes to further modify the service container before it gets its final
form.

After creating many bundles, I concluded that much of my work as a developer which is specific
for a Symfony application consists of writing code for exactly these things: bundle, extension and
configuration classes and compiler passes. When you know how to write good code, you still need
to know how to create good bundles, and this basically means that you need to know how to create
good service definitions. There are many ways to do this, and in this chapter I will describe most
of them. Knowing your options enables you to make better choices when looking for a dependency
injection pattern.
